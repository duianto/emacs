#+TITLE: anything の設定

* 始めに

沢山の人々を中毒にして「anything脳」という言葉まで流行させた anything.

* 読み込みと初期設定

** 読み込み.

自分で定義したマクロである [[http://www.gfd-dennou.org/member/uwabami/cc-env/EmacsBasic.html#not-locate-library][not-locate-library]] を使って
load-path を設定し require します.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (my:not-locate-library anything-config "site-lisp/anything-config")
  (my:not-locate-library anything-startup "site-lisp/anything-config/contrib")
  (require 'anything-startup)
#+end_src

** キーバインド

バッファ切り替え "\C-x b" に割り当てています.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; (define-key global-map (kbd "C-x b") 'anything)
  (define-key global-map (kbd "C-x b") 'anything-for-files)
#+end_src

いまんところこれだけ.
